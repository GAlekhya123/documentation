# Django Templates
### What is the use of templates ?
<p>A template is a file that serves as a starting point for a new document. When you open a template, it is pre-formatted in some way.</p>
<b>For example</b>:
<ul>
<li>you might use template in Microsoft Word that is formatted as a business letter.</li>
<li>The template would likely have a space for your name and address in the upper left corner, an area for the recipient's address a little below that on the left site, an area for the message body below that, and a spot for your signature at the bottom.</li>
</ul>
