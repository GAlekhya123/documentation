## Django Templates
<p>A template in Django is basically written in HTML, CSS and Javascript in an .html file. Django framework efficiently handles and generates dynamically HTML web pages that are visible to end-user.Django mainly functions with a backend so, in order to provide frontend and provide a layout to our website, we use templates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Django provides a convenient way to generate dynamic HTML pages by using its template system,creatively called the Django template language (DTL)</li>
<li>A template consists of static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic content will be inserted.</li>
</ul>

### Why Django Template ?
<ul>
<li>In HTML file, we can't write python code because the code is only interpreted by python interpreter not the browser. We know that HTML is a static markup language, while Python is a dynamic programming language.</li>
<li>Django template engine is used to separate the design from the python code and allows us to build dynamic web pages.</li>
</ul>

### Django Template Configuration

<p>To Configure the template system we have to provide some entries in settings.py file.</p>
